# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help a foundation predict where to make investments by using machine learning and neural networks. To do this, we were given a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding over the years. We were then tasked with creating a binary classifier capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded.

## Results

- Data Preprocessing
  - The `IS_SUCCESSFUL` column is considered the target for the model
  - The `EIN` and `NAME` columns are neither targets nor features, and were therefore removed from the input data
  - The remaining columns are considered to be the features for the model

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  - My original model was made up of neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - I as not able to achieve the target model performance
  - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
